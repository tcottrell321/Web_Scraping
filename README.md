# Web_Scraping
This repository hold several files to scrape key information and images from several Mars related websites, store them into a mongo DB and retrieve them for display on a custom webpage. The images and information can be updated with new information by the user with the use of a "web Scrapping" button - which calls the scrape_all object and returns updated information to the Mongo DB for rendering on the web page.
